            <p>
                This project was completed during the summer of 2024 as part of the Google Summer of Code program, under
                the Software and Computational Systems Lab at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.
            </p>
            <h2>Goal Of The Project</h2>
            <p>
                The main goal of the project was to extend PJBDD, a multi-threaded Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) library
                written in Java that supports concurrent computation, parallel operations, and automated resource
                management. BDDs provide a compact representation of Boolean formulas and are used for efficient
                manipulation.

                The extension aimed to build and manipulate CESRBDDs, enabling a BDD to be reduced even further than
                existing techniques, such as tagged or zero-suppressed BDDs, while maintaining its compact form. The
                broader goal is for CESRBDDs (Complemented Edge specific reduction Binary Decision Diagrams)
                to become the go-to standard for applications using BDDs in core
                algorithms, such as CPAChecker.


            </p>
            <h2>What Was Done</h2>
            <p> Before starting with the algorithms, we needed to define the structures and tables that would be used
                within the algorithms. The purpose of the unique tables was to store every node created, so if you
                attempt to create a new node, you can first check if it's already present in the unique table.
                Additionally, these tables use weak references to allow Java’s garbage collector to remove nodes that
                are no longer in use. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Defined and implemented the Node and Edge structures.</li>
                <li>Extended various unique tables to be compatible with CESRBDDs, including: <ul>
                        <li>Weak Hash Map unique table</li>
                        <li>Compare-and-Swap Array unique table</li>
                        <li>Weak Hash Deque unique table</li>
                        <li>Weak Array unique table</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Implemented the Node Manager, which handles the different unique tables and performs basic
                    operations like creating a node or getting a node’s level.</li>
                <li>Wrote unit tests for the Node Manager and unique tables to ensure functionality.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> After confirming that the Node Manager and unique tables functioned as expected, we moved on to
                implementing the algorithms responsible for manipulating CESRBDDs. This part was challenging because the
                paper contained ambiguities in its pseudocode, which required further investigation to clarify.
                Intensive testing was also conducted to ensure accuracy. In summary: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented the manipulation algorithms.</li>
                <li>Extensively tested the algorithms to ensure correct behavior, achieving 100% line coverage and 96%
                    branch coverage.</li>
            </ul>

            <p> The next step was to add the Creator to CESRBDDs. This interface, used throughout PJBDD, abstracts the
                underlying BDD from the user, so it was important to implement it correctly. Despite significant
                differences between regular BDDs and CESRBDDs—especially regarding the importance of edges—the main
                functionalities of the Creator were focused on performing Boolean operations between CESRBDDs. Some of
                these operations are listed below: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>makeVariable()</li>
                <li>makeFalse()</li>
                <li>makeAnd(DD, DD)</li>
                <li>makeNot(DD)</li>
                <li>makeOr(DD, DD)</li>
                <li>makeXor(DD, DD)</li>
                <li>makeNor(DD, DD)</li>
                <li>makeXnor(DD, DD)</li>
                <li>makeNand(DD, DD)</li>
                <li>makeEqual(DD, DD)</li>
                <li>makeUnequal(DD, DD)</li>
            </ul>
            <p> After implementing the Creator, we ran the Creator test suite to ensure it behaved as expected. We then
                moved on to the next step, which involved the following: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designing and implementing a SAT algorithm that retrieves a satisfying assignment for the decision
                    diagram (if available).</li>
                <li>Designing and implementing a SAT Count algorithm that returns the number of possible assignments to
                    a Boolean formula.</li>
                <li>Testing the SAT algorithms with SAT files and PJBDD examples, such as N-Queens, to ensure
                    reliability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> It is worth noting that the SAT algorithm solves an issue found in PJBDD with other Decision Diagrams
                <a href="https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/software/paralleljbdd/-/issues/31">Issue on Gitlab</a>. The final
                step was to add caching to the algorithms,
                which involved:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementing hashing for the nodes and edges.</li>
                <li>Configuring cache settings, including expiration times, to allow garbage collection of unused nodes.
                </li>
                <li>Extensively testing everything again to ensure the cache worked as expected.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>what code got merged</h2>
            <p>Here will be a link to the merge request</p>

            <h2>What Is Left to Do</h2>
            <p>There are mainly two tasks remaining:</p>
            <h4>Optimize the Way the Creator Works</h4>
            <p>For technical reasons, to use the Creator environment in the most efficient way, you must determine the
                number of variables in advance. Failing to do so will result in slower performance. The goal here is to
                explore ideas or optimizations to improve performance in cases where the number of variables is not
                predetermined.</p>
            <h4>Make More Applications Compatible with CESRBDDs</h4>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, CESRBDDs differ from other BDDs due to the importance of edges, which requires
                applications using PJBDD to adapt to these differences. One such application is the CPAchecker.</p>


            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
                below is an example of a regular BDDs along with its equivilant CESRBDDs You can notice the differnce in
                the node count and the info encoded on the edges
